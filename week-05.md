#  week5 recap ðŸ§ 

## Pure React (create react app without Babel)

#### 1. Create src folder
#### 2. Create html skeleton 
#### 3. Create root div
        
    (<div id="root"> All goes here </div>)
          
#### 4. Add React and ReactDOM
             
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.12.0/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.11.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

  
#### 5. Check if React is present :)
- console.log(React) 
- console.log(ReactDOM)


#### 6. create (functional) component 
(param - element, tag with id and value)
                            
    function App() {
    return React.createElement('div', { className: 'hello' },
    )};
                       
                       
#### 7. element inside another element - h1 inside of div tag 

    function App() {
    return React.createElement('div', { className: 'hello' },
    React.createElement('h1', {}, "Hello World")
     );
     }


#### 8. Render App component inside of root element    
              
    ReactDOM.render(
    react.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));

#### 9. create components in seperate files (multiple elements in an array)

    function Title(props) {
    return React.createElement('div', { className: "hello" }, [
     React.createElement('h1', {}, "Article Title"),
    React.createElement('h2', {}, "Subtitle"),
    React.createElement('p', {}, "Lorem ipsuma, minus similique sint mollitia a cumque consequatur illo minima?                    Similique animi iste labore."),
     ])
     };

#### 10. import seperate sheets.js into index.html 
                
    <script src="Title.js"></script>
    <script src="App.js"></script>
                  
                              
## React Router 
(https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)

- render components dynamically in a Single Page Application

How to create :
1) install 

       npm install react-router-dom
       
or
        
        yarn add react-router-dom
        
2) import 

        import { BrowserRouter as router, Switch} from "react-router-dom";

3) wrap all components in App.js in <Router/> component
 add <Switch>, looks through its children <Route>s and renders the first one that matches the current URL.

(name of the path is whatever u want)


        <Router>
      <Navbar />
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/">
          <Homepage />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/about-us">
          <AboutUs />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/contact">
          <Contact />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>

4)  OR 

        <Route exact path="/" component={Homepage} />
        <Route path="/aboutUs" component={AboutUs} />
        <Route exact path="/contact" component={contact} />


5) import links 

        import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

6) add link inside li tag

         <h3><Link to="/">My super Company</Link></h3>
         <li className="nav-items"><Link to="/About">Infos</Link></li>


#### Navlink 
-  Link and Navlink allow you to navigate to different routes defined in the application.

        import { Navlink } from 'react-router-dom';

Change css when link active 

       <li className="nav-items"><NavLink activeClassName="active" to="About">About</NavLink></li>


# HTTP
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.

<img width="563" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 08 43 15" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52657665/74412167-1de8f780-4e3d-11ea-94c4-8d6012439163.png">

Request methods :

1) GET - method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

2) POST -  method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server

3) DELETE - method deletes the specified resource.

4) CONNECT -  method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.


# PROMISE 
- The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.


![promises](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52657665/74412658-34dc1980-4e3e-11ea-8750-33d89f5a55c4.png)

Working with promises : 
1) create a promise instance using Promise() Constructor
2) Define what should happen when promise is fulfilled or rejected
3) Consume the value of the fulfilled promise or provide ar provide a rejection reason for a rejected promise, 

        const myNewPromise = new Promise ((resolve, reject)=> {
        setTimeOut (()=>{
        resolve ("Your order is ready!")
        },3000);
        });


        myNewPromise.then(val => console.log(val))
        
(returns fullfiled value (whatever passed into resolve is avalible here ))

Promise.all() - method returns a single Promise that fulfills when all of the promises passed as an iterable have been fulfilled ( usefull when program needs to wait more than one promise to resolve ). It rejects with the reason of the first promise 


### Synchronous programing : 
In a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time. When you call a function that performs a long-running action, it returns only when the action has finished and it can return the result. This stops your program for the time the action takes.

### Asynchronous programing : 
An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time. When you start an action, your program continues to run. When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets access to the result (for example, the data read from disk).
- Promises

## Functional programming - 
form of programming in which you can pass functions as parameters to other functions and also return them as values.

First-Class Functions (first-class citizens)


Higher order function - functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. (function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output)

For example :
- Array.prototype.map, 
- Array.prototype.filter,
- Array.prototype.reduce


-------------------------------------------------------------------

### .sort() method - 
sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

### Fibonacci sequence algorithm in Javascript

Given a number X return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
Pattern of the sequence is that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values, that means that for
x=5 â†’ 2+3 or in maths: F(x) = F(x-1) + F(x-2)



solution 1 
                             
                             function fibonacci() {
                          if (num <= 1) return 1;
                           return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
                          }

solution 2 

                        function fibonachi (num){
                        let resultArray = [1, 1,]
                          let firstNumber = 1;
                          let result = 1;
                          for (let i = 0; i <= num; i++){
                            result += firstNumber;
                            resultArray.push(result);
                            firstNumber =result - firstNumber;
                          }
                          return resultArray;
                        }
                        console.log(fibonachi(10));

solution 3 



                        function fibonacci(x) {
                            let arr = [0, 1];
                            for (let i = 0; i < x; i++) {
                              arr.push(arr[i] + arr[i + 1]);
                              console.log(arr);
                            }
                          }
                          fibonacci(x);
